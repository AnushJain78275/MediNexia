# MediNexia
Using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, form submission, and CloudHQ, I successfully developed my own health bot called ‘MediNexia’ without relying on Azure services. This project allowed me to create a customized virtual assistant tailored to specific healthcare needs while leveraging the power of web technologies.
